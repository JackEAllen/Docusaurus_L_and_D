## Nightly Build

### Question 
Would a nightly build of the IBEX GUI be of use? It would be unsupported and not formally tested but would allow the use of features that were developed early. The features would appear fully tested in the next release. If there is interest what is the priority of this?

### Answer
`not asked yet`
